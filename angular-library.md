Creating reusable libraries in Angular involves several steps, from generating the library to packaging, publishing, and sharing it. Here’s a complete guide:

---

### **1. Generate a Library**
Angular provides a built-in command to create a library:

```bash
ng generate library library-name
```

This will create a folder for your library inside the `projects` directory in your Angular workspace.

### **2. Structure Your Library**
Organize the library's structure to ensure scalability and reusability:
- **Public API**: Expose only the necessary modules, components, and services in the `public-api.ts` file.
- **Barrel Files**: Use `index.ts` files in subdirectories for clean exports.

Example: `projects/library-name/src/public-api.ts`
```typescript
export * from './lib/library-name.module';
export * from './lib/components/sample.component';
export * from './lib/services/sample.service';
```

### **3. Develop the Library**
- **Components**: Use Angular CLI to generate reusable components.
```bash
ng generate component my-component --project=library-name
```

- **Services**: Create injectable services as needed.
```bash
ng generate service my-service --project=library-name
```

- Follow good practices for component encapsulation, input/output bindings, and dependency injection.

### **4. Build the Library**
Before using or publishing the library, build it using:
```bash
ng build library-name
```

This compiles the library into the `dist/` folder.

### **5. Test the Library Locally**
To test the library in another Angular application:
- Link the library locally:
  ```bash
  cd dist/library-name
  npm link
  ```
- Use it in another project:
  ```bash
  npm link library-name
  ```
- Import the library in the `app.module.ts` of your testing project.

---

### **6. Package and Publish the Library**
- Ensure your `package.json` is configured correctly in the library's root folder (e.g., `projects/library-name/package.json`).
- Add metadata, dependencies, and peer dependencies.
- Publish to a package registry (e.g., npm):
  ```bash
  cd dist/library-name
  npm publish --access public
  ```

---

### **7. Distribute Privately (Optional)**
If the library is for internal use:
- Publish to a private npm registry (e.g., Azure Artifacts, Verdaccio).
- Alternatively, share the library as a `.tgz` package:
  ```bash
  npm pack
  ```
  Share the `.tgz` file, and it can be installed via:
  ```bash
  npm install ./path-to-tgz-file
  ```

---

### **8. Document the Library**
- Provide clear usage instructions in a `README.md`.
- Include examples of how to import and use the components, services, or modules.

---

### **9. Maintain the Library**
- Add versioning (e.g., using `npm version`).
- Follow semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`) to track updates and changes.
- Regularly update dependencies and ensure compatibility with new Angular versions.

---

### **10. Make the Library Public**
If publishing to npm:
- Create an account on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- Set the `access` to `public` during the `npm publish`.

Now, others can install it using:
```bash
npm install library-name
```

### **Tools and Tips**
- **Ng-packagr**: Angular uses it internally for building libraries.
- **Schematics**: Add schematics to your library to provide code scaffolding capabilities.
- **Style Guide**: Follow Angular style guide practices for consistent development.
- **Linting**: Use `eslint` or `tslint` to enforce coding standards.

By following these steps, you can create modular, reusable, and shareable Angular libraries for use across your organization or by the broader public.

To publish an Angular library internally to Azure Artifacts, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Prepare Azure DevOps and Azure Artifacts**
1. **Set Up Azure DevOps Organization**:
   - Ensure you have access to an Azure DevOps organization.
   - Create a project or use an existing one.

2. **Enable Azure Artifacts**:
   - Navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project**.
   - Select **Artifacts** from the left menu.
   - Create a new feed for your internal packages (e.g., `internal-angular-packages`).

---

### **2. Configure Your Library for Publishing**
1. **Update `package.json`**:
   Modify the library’s `package.json` file (inside `projects/library-name/`):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@your-org/library-name",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Your Angular library",
     "main": "bundles/library-name.umd.js",
     "module": "fesm2015/library-name.js",
     "es2015": "fesm2015/library-name.js",
     "typings": "library-name.d.ts",
     "peerDependencies": {
       "@angular/core": "^16.0.0",
       "@angular/common": "^16.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Build the Library**:
   Compile the library using Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   ng build library-name
   ```

   The output will be in the `dist/library-name/` folder.

---

### **3. Authenticate with Azure Artifacts**
1. **Obtain the Azure Artifacts Feed URL**:
   - Go to **Artifacts** in your Azure DevOps project.
   - Select the feed (e.g., `internal-angular-packages`).
   - Click on **Connect to Feed** and choose `npm` as the package manager.
   - Copy the feed URL (e.g., `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/`).

2. **Authenticate with Azure Artifacts**:
   - Add the following to your `.npmrc` file in the library root (or globally in `~/.npmrc`):
     ```bash
     registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/
     always-auth=true

     //pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/:username=your-username
     //pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/:_password=your-pat-token
     //pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/:email=your-email
     ```
   - Replace `your-pat-token` with a Personal Access Token (PAT) that has permissions for `Packaging (Read & Write)`.

   To generate a PAT:
   - Go to **User Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens** in Azure DevOps.
   - Generate a token with the appropriate scope.

---

### **4. Publish the Library to Azure Artifacts**
1. Navigate to the library's `dist` folder:
   ```bash
   cd dist/library-name
   ```

2. Publish the library:
   ```bash
   npm publish --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/
   ```

---

### **5. Consume the Library**
1. Add the Azure Artifacts feed URL to the `.npmrc` file in your consuming project:
   ```bash
   registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/
   always-auth=true
   ```

2. Install the library:
   ```bash
   npm install @your-org/library-name
   ```

---

### **6. Automate with CI/CD (Optional)**
Set up a pipeline in Azure DevOps to build and publish the library automatically:
1. **Create a Build Pipeline**:
   - Use an Angular build task to compile the library.
   - Add an `npm publish` task to upload the library to the Azure Artifacts feed.

2. **Example YAML Pipeline**:
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
         - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   steps:
     - task: NodeTool@0
       inputs:
         versionSpec: '16.x'
       displayName: 'Install Node.js'

     - script: |
         npm install
         ng build library-name
       displayName: 'Build Library'

     - script: |
         cd dist/library-name
         npm publish --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/internal-angular-packages/npm/registry/
       displayName: 'Publish to Azure Artifacts'
   ```

---

### **Best Practices**
- Use semantic versioning for your library.
- Regularly update peer dependencies to match Angular's latest version.
- Document the library in the feed with usage instructions.

By following these steps, you can publish Angular libraries internally to Azure Artifacts, ensuring easy and secure distribution within your organization.
