**Disaster Recovery (DR)** plays a critical role in ensuring your **distributed system** can survive and recover from **major failures** like data center outages, natural disasters, human errors, or large-scale cyberattacks. It’s about **minimizing downtime and data loss** when things go really wrong — beyond just failover.


## What is Disaster Recovery?

**Disaster Recovery** is the set of **policies, tools, processes, and infrastructure** used to **recover your system** and **restore service** after a catastrophic failure.

> DR ≠ Failover:
>
> * **Failover** is typically *automatic and fast* (like switching AZs).
> * **DR** is often *broader, slower*, and sometimes manual (like restoring in another region after total failure).


## Key Objectives of DR

| Metric                             | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**  | How quickly you must restore service after a failure. |
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | How much **data loss** (in time) you can tolerate.    |

> Example:
>
> * RTO = 1 hour → You must be back online within 1 hour.
> * RPO = 15 minutes → You can afford to lose at most 15 minutes of data.


## Components of a Good DR Strategy

### 1. **Backup and Restore**

* Periodic full + incremental backups (database, logs, state)
* Store backups in **different regions** or **external systems**
* Use services like:

  * AWS Backup
  * S3 versioning + Glacier
  * SQL Server backup to S3 blob
  * DynamoDB on-demand backups

### 2. **Data Replication**

* Use **multi-region replication** to avoid single-point-of-failure:

  * DynamoDB Global Tables
  * Aurora Global Database
  * S3 Cross-Region Replication
* Keep replicas **in sync** for minimal RPO

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

* Use Terraform/CDK/CloudFormation to recreate infrastructure on demand.
* Makes failover repeatable and fast.

### 4. **Cross-Region Deployments**

* Set up **standby environments** in another AWS region
* Use Route 53 health checks for **DNS-level failover**

### 5. **Monitoring & Alerts**

* Detect outages quickly using:

  * CloudWatch alarms
  * Synthetic transactions (canary tests)
  * Third-party monitoring

### 6. **Security & Compliance**

* Backup encryption
* Tamper-proof audit logs
* Recovery drills for compliance (e.g., ISO, SOC2, GDPR)


## Types of Disaster Recovery Architectures

| Type                           | RTO / RPO         | Cost    | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backup & Restore**           | High RTO/RPO      | Low     | Manual restore from backups                             |
| **Pilot Light**                | Med RTO/RPO       | Medium  | Minimal infra running in standby, scaled up when needed |
| **Warm Standby**               | Low RTO/RPO       | Higher  | Partially active replica system ready to take over      |
| **Multi-Region Active-Active** | Near-zero RTO/RPO | Highest | Fully synced infra across regions, routing via Route 53 |


## DR in AWS Distributed Systems

| Service                | DR Feature / Role                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **DynamoDB**           | Global Tables replicate across regions         |
| **S3**                 | Cross-region replication, versioning           |
| **RDS/Aurora**         | Global DBs or manual cross-region replicas     |
| **Route 53**           | Health checks + DNS failover                   |
| **CloudFormation/CDK** | Infra redeployment in failover region          |
| **Lambda**             | Re-deploy functions across regions             |
| **API Gateway**        | Multi-region setup with custom domain failover |


## Example Scenario

### Primary Region Fails (e.g., us-east-1)

1. **Health checks fail** on primary resources.
2. **Route 53** redirects traffic to standby in **us-west-2**.
3. **DynamoDB Global Tables** in west-2 start serving traffic.
4. **Lambda/API Gateway** already deployed in both regions.
5. Logs show failover and alerts trigger response team.

> Downtime: < 2 minutes if Active-Active
> Data Loss: 0 seconds (if using strongly consistent Global Tables)


## Best Practices

* Define **business RTO/RPO** per system or microservice
* Test DR with **chaos engineering** and **game days**
* Automate backup validation & restoration
* Monitor replication lags
* Store runbooks and automate recovery as much as possible


## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                        | Consequence                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Backups only in primary region | Total data loss in region outage   |
| No regular DR drills           | Team unprepared during real outage |
| No IaC for recovery            | Slow, error-prone failover         |
| Assuming failover is instant   | Downtime is longer than expected   |


## Summary

| Aspect               | Key Point                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose of DR        | Recover from catastrophic events (region failures, disasters) |
| Not same as failover | DR is broader and often involves cross-region strategy        |
| RTO / RPO            | Guide your architecture choices                               |
| AWS Services         | Many built-in options (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, Route 53)           |
| Best practice        | **Automate + test** your recovery process regularly           |

| **Monitoring**     | CloudWatch + X-Ray + Health Checks   | Alert on failures and latency anomalies    |


## 3. **Deployment Strategy**

### A. **Initial Setup**

* Choose two regions: e.g., `us-east-1` (primary), `us-west-2` (secondary)
* Set up **VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups** identically in both
* Use **Infrastructure as Code (CDK/Terraform)** to replicate your stack

### B. **Application Deployment**

* Build and containerize your .NET microservices (Docker + ECS or Lambda)
* Deploy microservices and dependencies (Redis, Secrets, API Gateway) to **both regions**

### C. **Data Layer**

* Use **DynamoDB Global Tables** for active-active writes
* For relational DBs, consider **Aurora Global Database** (read from secondary, write to primary)

### D. **Routing & Failover**

* Set up **Route 53** with:

  * **Latency-based routing** (preferred)
  * OR **Failover routing** (primary → secondary)
* Enable **health checks** on API Gateway endpoints or custom health APIs


## 4. **Synchronization Between Regions**

| Component        | Sync Strategy                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DynamoDB**     | Global Tables (auto replication)                                |
| **SQS**          | Use **DLQs** and optionally **cross-region SQS**                |
| **EventBridge**  | Use **EventBridge Pipes** or custom fan-out to replicate events |
| **Cache**        | Redis Global Datastore (multi-region) OR rehydrate on failover  |
| **Files/Assets** | S3 with Cross-Region Replication (CRR)                          |


## 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**

* Use GitHub Actions / CodePipeline to:

  * Package and push Docker images to **ECR in both regions**
  * Deploy microservices using **CDK/Terraform** with region parameter
* Deploy to **staging** and **production** environments **per region**
* Validate with **integration tests** and **route switch simulations**


## 6. **Failure Handling and DR**

| Scenario            | Recovery Mechanism                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| AZ failure          | Managed by ELB/ALB across subnets                  |
| Lambda failure      | Auto-retries + DLQ + provisioned concurrency       |
| Region failure      | Route 53 fails over to secondary region            |
| DB failure          | Global Tables auto-syncs or failover Aurora writer |
| Cache/infra failure | Redis replica, S3 replication, redeploy            |


## 7. **Monitoring and Observability**

| Tool                       | Purpose                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **CloudWatch Alarms**      | Detect function errors, latency spikes |
| **Route 53 Health Checks** | Failover trigger                       |
| **X-Ray**                  | Trace API performance and errors       |
| **AWS Config + GuardDuty** | Security compliance monitoring         |


## 8. **Testing Multi-Region Setup**

* Run **chaos tests** to simulate:

  * Region failover
  * API unavailability
  * Partial DB replication lag
* Use tools like:

  * **AWS Fault Injection Simulator**
  * **Gremlin (3rd party)**


## 9. **Security Best Practices**

* Use **VPC endpoints** and **private APIs**
* Secure communication with **TLS**, **IAM**, and **resource policies**
* Use **least privilege** IAM roles for Lambda/ECS tasks


## 10. Cost Considerations

| Area                        | Cost Impact                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-region compute**    | 2x ECS/Lambda/infra                   |
| **DynamoDB Global Tables**  | Extra for cross-region replication    |
| **API Gateway**             | Requests per region billed separately |
| **S3 CRR + Data Transfer**  | Charged per GB replicated             |
| **Provisioned concurrency** | Higher cost for reliability           |

Use **Savings Plans** and **auto-scaling** where applicable.
