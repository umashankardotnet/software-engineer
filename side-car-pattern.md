# Complete Guide: Sidecar Pattern in Distributed .NET Applications on AWS ECS

## Overview

The **Sidecar Pattern** is a design pattern in microservices architecture where auxiliary tasks (like logging, monitoring, proxying) are handled by a co-located helper container (called a sidecar) deployed alongside the main application container. This pattern is common in **cloud-native environments**, particularly **Kubernetes** and **Amazon ECS**.

---

## What is the Sidecar Pattern?

* A **sidecar** is a separate container deployed in the **same pod or ECS task** as the primary application.
* It provides supporting functionalities **without modifying the main app's code**.
* Common responsibilities: logging, monitoring, secret management, service mesh proxying, configuration loading.

Think of it like a motorcycle with a sidecar: both run together, share the same lifecycle and resources, but the sidecar adds extra capabilities.

## Benefits

| Benefit                | Explanation                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Separation of concerns | Business logic is clean; ops/logging logic is separate |
| Reusability            | Same sidecar image can be reused across services       |
| Technology agnostic    | Sidecar can be built with different tools/languages    |
| Observability          | Add metrics, logs, and tracing with no code change     |
| Standardization        | Uniform logging, auth, proxy policies across services  |

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case                  | Sidecar Function                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logging**               | Collect and ship logs to CloudWatch, Elasticsearch (e.g., Filebeat, Fluent Bit) |
| **Monitoring**            | Metrics aggregation and forwarding (e.g., Prometheus Exporter, OpenTelemetry)   |
| **Service Mesh**          | Sidecar proxies like Envoy handle routing, retries, mTLS                        |
| **Authentication**        | Sidecar handles token validation or OAuth2 handshake                            |
| **Configuration/Secrets** | Vault Agent or AWS SSM agent loads secrets/config                               |

## Example: .NET 8 Web API + Filebeat on Amazon ECS

### Architecture

```
+----------------------------+
|        ECS Task            |
|                            |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  | .NET Web API         |  |
|  | Writes to /app/logs  |  |
|  +----------------------+  |
|                            |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  | Filebeat Sidecar     |  |
|  | Ships logs to        |  |
|  | OpenSearch           |  |
|  +----------------------+  |
+----------------------------+
```

---

### Docker Image (Main .NET App)

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./publish /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyService.dll"]
```

---

### Filebeat Configuration (filebeat.yml)

```yaml
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    paths:
      - /app/logs/*.log
    scan_frequency: 5s

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://search-your-opensearch-domain.region.es.amazonaws.com"]
  index: "ecs-logs"
  username: "your-user"
  password: "your-password"
  ssl.verification_mode: none
```

### ECS Task Definition Snippet

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "dotnet-service",
      "image": "<your-repo>:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "mountPoints": [
        {
          "sourceVolume": "shared-logs",
          "containerPath": "/app/logs"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "filebeat",
      "image": "docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:8.13.4",
      "essential": false,
      "command": ["-e", "-c", "/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml"],
      "mountPoints": [
        {
          "sourceVolume": "shared-logs",
          "containerPath": "/app/logs"
        },
        {
          "sourceVolume": "filebeat-config",
          "containerPath": "/usr/share/filebeat"
        }
      ],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/filebeat-sidecar",
          "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "filebeat"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "volumes": [
    { "name": "shared-logs" },
    { "name": "filebeat-config" }
  ]
}
```

## IAM Role Permissions

Attach ECS task role permissions:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "es:ESHttpPut",
    "es:ESHttpPost",
    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

## Best Practices

| Practice                           | Why It Matters                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mark sidecar as `essential: false` | App still runs if sidecar crashes             |
| Use shared volumes                 | For log file access between containers        |
| Secure communication               | Use SSL and scoped IAM roles                  |
| Centralized config management      | Reduce duplication, use Parameter Store or S3 |

| Language           | Go                  | C                         |
| Config Flexibility | High                | Medium                    |
| Performance        | Medium              | High                      |

## Final Thoughts

The **Sidecar Pattern** is ideal when you need **modular, reusable, infrastructure-level services** tightly coupled with your application lifecycle — but without polluting business logic. On ECS, this is easily achieved by bundling sidecars into a single task definition.

**Filebeat** works seamlessly in this model to ship logs, improving observability with minimal development effort.

You can also use this pattern for:

* mTLS communication via Envoy
* Token exchange or secrets mounting via Vault Agent
* Background sync jobs (e.g., DB replication, backups)
